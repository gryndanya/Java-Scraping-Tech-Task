<p>We believe learning with a great tutor is life-changing. That‚Äôs why we match online tutors from across the globe with learners and empower them to create live language classes with AI-powered tools and learning materials. This is how we deliver progress, create engagement and keep our global community of learners motivated. So far, over 32,000 tutors have given more than 15 million lessons to learners from over 175 countries.</p>
<h3><strong>Design at Preply</strong></h3>
<p>At Preply, we know learning with the right tutor can be life-changing. Helping to change the lives of people is an amazing opportunity and a big responsibility. It takes a large, diverse, multidisciplinary team to create a learning product, and Design is at the very heart of that team.</p>
<p>Preply‚Äôs Design mission is to deliver the most beautiful language-learning experience in the world. As the poet once wrote, ‚ÄúBeauty is truth. Truth is beauty.‚Äù We take this definition to heart. We craft beautiful surfaces that delight our users and inspire them to learn and teach. But we also dive deep and go beyond surface beauty, to uncover the truth behind our users‚Äô needs and motivations. By combining all of this, we create holistic experiences that help our users achieve their goals.</p>
<p>To achieve our mission, we need the best designers out there. We need creative thinkers, great product ""detectives"", and people who care about their impact on the world.</p>
<h3><strong>Product-Led Growth</strong></h3>
<p>Learning is about more than achieving a goal or performing a task. It's a journey of self-discovery and improvement. That's why at Preply we talk about ""learning journeys"": we think the metaphor of a ""journey"" captures the essence of the transformation that learners go through. They start in one place, end in another, and are changed in the process.</p>
<p>And, just like in a real-life journey, there are amazing moments that learners should be able to share with the people they care about: moments of pride, moments of achievement, moments worth celebrating. As the Product-Led Growth designer, you will help learners uncover and share these moments with the world, while simultaneously spreading the word about the power of Preply in the process.</p>
<p>Your work will help motivate today's learners to complete their journeys and inspire future learners to begin their own.</p>
<h3><strong>What you‚Äôll be doing:</strong></h3>
<ul>
 <li>Collaborating closely with product and engineering peers, you will own and perfect this make or break segment of a learner‚Äôs journey.</li>
 <li>You will also partner with your Growth designers to ensure a coherent, consistent and delightful experience for all new learners from the moment they arrive to the moment they commit to learning with a tutor</li>
 <li>Finally, you will play an important role in Preply‚Äôs larger design and product org by contributing to Preply‚Äôs Design System and helping create a bespoke, app-centric Preply Design Language</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What you need to succeed:</strong></h3>
<ul>
 <li>Minimum of 4+ years of professional Product Design experience<br>
  Compelling, proven professional experience as a product designer.<br>
  Experience in conducting and leading research, and leveraging insights to do excellent product ‚Äúdetective‚Äù work.<br>
  Strong communication skills to effectively present your work and bring key stakeholders on board. You are confident in your ideas but open to learning from others.<br>
  You have experience handing off work to engineers, the dedication and focus to work alongside them to ensure high quality design on launch. <br>
  You have the drive to share work early and often, and to foster a mindset of collective ownership and effort. You leave the ego at the door.<br>
  As a plus, we value any experience working on the ‚Äúseller side‚Äù (e.g. content creators, sellers, advertisers, ‚Ä¶) of marketplaces, as well as experience using emotional design to deliver ‚Äúdelightful‚Äù experiences<br>
  A portfolio to help us understand your skills and experience as a designer.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Why you‚Äôll love it at Preply: </strong></h3>
<ul>
 <li>An open, collaborative, dynamic and diverse culture;</li>
 <li>A generous monthly allowance for lessons on<a href=""http://preply.com/""> Preply.com</a>, Learning &amp; Development budget and time off for your self-development;</li>
